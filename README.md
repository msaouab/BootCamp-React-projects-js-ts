## React Projects for Beginners in 2023 – Fun Ideas

You're ready to start making simple projects with React, but you don't know what to make. Where should you start?

I have created seven unique and fun React projects for you to make, all of which will teach you essential React concepts that you need to know in 2023.

Unlike other recommended projects which require you going to use multiple third-party libraries, all of these projects only use the core React library. Each of them use the latest React version (18) and no CSS frameworks.

My goal in creating this guide is to show you that you don't need a ton of code and special libraries to start building cool things with React.

Let's get started!

### 1. Image Carousel
- The first React project on our list is an image slider or carousel.

*React concepts you will learn:*
- useState (storing and updating state)
- Conditionals (ternaries)
- Lists, keys, and .map()

Final result: [comming soon]()

### 2. FAQ/Accordion
- Another common type of component which can utilizes state is an accordion component, which can both reveal and hide text.

*React concepts you will learn:*
- Toggling state with useState
- Passing data to components via props
- Displaying multiple components with .map()

Final result: [comming soon]()

### 3. Quote Generator
- Using external APIs and making HTTP requests are an essential part of any React application. To learn how to make HTTP requests in React, we will make a random quote generator.

*React concepts you will learn:*
- useEffect (to perform side effects)
- HTTP requests with Fetch API
- Conditional chaining operator (?)

Final result: [comming soon]()
